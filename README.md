# MvcTraining
All materials of the MVC training sessions at prodigious will be found here.

Each training session will have the same set of resources: 

>1. Presentation for guidance on the contents
>2. Visual Studio sample solution as worked on the trainning session. The first session solution will reflect all the exercises done on the first session and from then on each solution will reflect the initial state of the solution at each session.
>3. A readme file with extra links to useful resources and notes on the session

##Solution
It is the intention to work on a custom project through all the trainning. Each session will have a cumultive version of the solution. That will render difficult to work on the repository directly, and it is not the intention of this repository. This i only a way to share the documentation and code.

**always fork this repository**

##Session topics

### 1. Welcome to MVC

MVC fundamentals, Some design patterns, How it works and why it is useful? What to consider when desinging the architecture of the application? And a very basic status messaging web applicaition to play with.
