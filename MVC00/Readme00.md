In this session we will go through all the fundamentalls of MVC design pattern and its implementation in visual studio. First we will go through a little summary on deign patterns and from that point we will understand MVC pattern, it's foundations and purposes. Some comparisons against ASP.NET Web forms will help ypu take advantage of previous knowledge in web development with Visual Studio and .net framework. Then we will explore each component of MVC, models, views and controllers in detail. Finally we will cover some client-side and server-side processing considerations as well as useful suggerstions for preparing your applications for scalability.
